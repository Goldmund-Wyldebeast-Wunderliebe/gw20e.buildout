# Store cluster settings in separate file. 
# They can be shared by envs and apps on the same machines.
# Example: cluster-madras-saag.cfg
extends = cluster-X.cfg

## If you're deploying a buildout, first ask yourself if you need 4 instances.
## Please use 1 or 2 two instances for a 'normal' Plone site. Using 4 instances
## quickly increases memory usage. Remove the instances from this config and 
## from ./etc/haproxy.cfg.in
